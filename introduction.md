# Introduction

## What is Shiny

- An R framework for creating rich, interactive web applications
- No knowledge requirement of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript (until you want to go beyond the basics that Shiny provides)
- Take your work in R and expose it via a web browser
- Produce polished web apps with a minimum amount of pain
- Curated set of UI functions that generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed for common tasks
- UI components can be easily customized or extended
- Server uses reactive programming for any type of back end logic
- Designed to feel almost magically easy
- Yet built out of general building blocks that have strong software engineering principles
- Reactive Programming paradigm: Automatically tracks the dependencies of a code chunk

## Where is Shiny Used

- By academia as a teaching tool for statistical concepts
- By big pharma companies to speed collaboration between scientists and analysts during drug development
- By Silicon Valley tech companies to set up realtime metrics dashboards with advanced analytics

## How is Shiny Used

- Create dashboards
- Replace hundreds of pages of PDFs with interactive apps
- Communicate complex models to a non-technical audience
- Self-service data analysis for common workflows: Allows people to upload their own data and perform standard analyses
- Create interactive demos for teaching statistics and data science concepts
- Leverage automation processes
- Create prototypes of web applications
